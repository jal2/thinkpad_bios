What's left to do (no specific order) ?

1) Document a way to update a single section using flashrom

2) Add code to scan the BIOS modules, try to find the BIOS version.
   I guess it is in compressed code, strings didn't show it.

3) If we try to recover the BIOS after a bad update, it would help
   to know the version of the EC currently flashed.

4) Document how we can process an official Lenovo BIOS (.exe, .iso) into
   a .WPH and .bin file.

5) Think about the SLIC entry in the BIOS - just overwriting the BIOS section
   of a SPI flash device with the section from a *.WPH file will probably
   remove any SLIC / SLP in ACPI. If #2 above is solved, we may be able 
   to extract the SLIC / SLP entry from the flash device unless it got 
   corrupted by the failed BIOS update. We may try to add a SLIC2.1 to
   the BIOS prior to writing it to flash - similar to the phoenix tools
   linked in the README.  But why does it need the complete ACPI table?
