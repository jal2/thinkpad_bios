What's left to do (no specific order) ?

1) Document a way to update a single section using flashrom

2) Add code to scan the BIOS modules, try to find the BIOS version.
   I guess it is in compressed code, strings didn't show it.

3) If we try to recover the BIOS after a bad update, it would help
   to know the version of the EC currently flashed.

4) Document how we can process an official Lenovo BIOS (.exe, .iso) into
   a .WPH and .bin file.
